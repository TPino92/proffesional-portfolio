          <p>I‚Äôm a self-confessed tech geek. I have always been curious about the ways things work. From a young age, I enjoyed taking my toys apart, to make them more efficient, and then putting them back together again. Ruined quite a few remote control cars before I started getting good at the process. Before high school, I was the family "IT Guy". I joined the after school Robotics Team and participated in Computer Programming Summer Camps. Today, I build high-end computers for myself and others and other tech work, just for fun. Early in 2020, I decided I was ready for a career change -- it was time to pursue my passion for technology, So I researched my options and applied to the University of Arizona's Fullstack Web Development program.
          Soon I will be a certified Web Developer. Skilled in UX and UI improvements needed for websites to be successful. I pride myself on my ability to work collaboratively with groups to meet job quality and time requirements.
          Born and raised in California, I am currently living my best life in New Mexico with my finance, Amanda, and our two "children" Spartacus ‚Äçüêà and Albert üêà.</p>
